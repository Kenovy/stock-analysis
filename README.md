### Overerall Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code


**Advantages:** Your code will be better organized after refactoring, as the main reason of refactoring a code is to change the structure of the code, and not the "functionallity. We could say that we are cleaning the room to looks better :) 

**Disadvantages:** We are moving the code, it always b a risk to broke something. You need to plan and set a good roadmap before move forward. 


### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

**Advantages:** Less code makes run faster, compared to the previous structure, the analysis is executed in a faster time.

**Disadvantages:** At least, for this Analysis there wasnÂ´t any disadvantage, all run well and actually we did it more friendly improving the look and feel of our file adding two buttons.
